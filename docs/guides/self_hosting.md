# Self Hosting _[Experimental]_
**This guide is currently highly experimental. Instructions are subject to change as we improve support for self-hosting.**

We provide a Helm chart that deploys LLM Engine to an [Elastic Kubernetes Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS) in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). This Helm chart should be configured to connect to dependencies (such as a PostgreSQL database) that you may already have available in your environment.

The only portions of the Helm chart that are production ready are the parts that configure and manage LLM Server itself (not PostgreSQL, IAM, etc.)

We first go over required AWS dependencies that are required to exist before we can run `helm install` in your EKS cluster.

## AWS Dependencies 

This section describes assumptions about existing AWS resources required run to the LLM Engine Server

### EKS 
The LLM Engine server must be deployed in an EKS cluster environment. Currently only versions `1.23+` are supported. Below are the assumed requirements for the EKS cluster: 

You will need to provision EKS node groups with GPUs to schedule model pods. These node groups must have the `node-lifecycle: normal` label on them.
Additionally, they must have the `k8s.amazonaws.com/accelerator` label set appropriately depending on the instance type:

| Instance family | `k8s.amazonaws.com/accelerator` label |
| --- | --- |
| g4dn | nvidia-tesla-t4 |
| g5 | nvidia-tesla-a10 |
| p4d | nvidia-tesla-a100 |
| p4de | nvidia-tesla-a100e |

We also recommend setting the following taint on your GPU nodes to prevent pods requiring GPU resources from being scheduled on them:
- { key = "nvidia.com/gpu", value = "true", effect = "NO_SCHEDULE" }


### PostgreSQL

The LLM Engine server requires a PostgreSQL database to back data. LLM Engine currently supports PostgreSQL version 14.
Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g. AWS RDS PostgreSQL) if you do not have an existing one you wish to connect LLM Engine to.

To enable LLM Engine to connect to the PostgreSQL engine, we create a Kubernetes secret with the PostgreSQL url. An example YAML is provided below:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: llm-engine-database-credentials  # this name will be an input to our Helm Chart
data:
    database_url = "postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]"
```

### Redis

The LLM Engine server requires Redis for various caching/queue functionality. LLM Engine currently supports Redis version 6.
Create a Redis cluster (e.g. AWS Elasticache for Redis) if you do not have an existing one you wish to connect LLM Engine to.

To enable LLM Engine to connect redis, fill out the Helm chart values with the redis host and url.

### Amazon S3

You will need to have an S3 bucket for LLM Engine to store various assets (e.g model weigts, prediction restuls). The ARN of this bucket should be provided in the Helm chart values.

### Amazon ECR

You will need to provide an ECR repository for the deployment to store model containers. The ARN of this repository should be provided in the Helm chart values.

### Amazon SQS

LLM Engine utilizes Amazon SQS to keep track of jobs. LLM Engine will create and use SQS queues as needed.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The LLM Engine server will an IAM role to perform various AWS operations. This role will be assumed by the serviceaccount `llm-engine` in the `launch` namespace in the EKS cluster. The ARN of this role needs to be provided to the Helm chart, and the role needs to be provided the following permissions:

| Action | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| `s3:Get*`, `s3:Put*` | `${s3_bucket_arn}/*` |
| `s3:List*` | `${s3_bucket_arn}` |
| `sqs:*` | `arn:aws:sqs:${region}:${account_id}:llm-engine-endpoint-id-*` |
| `sqs:ListQueues` | `*` |
| `ecr:BatchGetImage`, `ecr:DescribeImages`, `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`, `ecr:ListImages` | `${ecr_repository_arn}` |

## Helm Chart
Now that all dependencies have been installed and configured, we can run the provided Helm chart. The values in the Helm chart will need to correspond with the resources described in the Dependencies section. 

Ensure that Helm V3 is installed [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and can connect to the EKS cluster. Users should be able to install the chart with `helm install llm-engine llm-engine -f llm-engine/values_sample.yaml -n <DESIRED_NAMESPACE>`.

## Play With It
Once `helm install` succeeds, you can forward port `5000` from a `llm-engine` pod and test sending requests to it.

First, see a list of pods in the namespace that you performed `helm install` in:
```
$ kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE_WHERE_LLM_ENGINE_IS_INSTALLED>
NAME                                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
llm-engine-668679554-9q4wj                     1/1     Running            0             18m
llm-engine-668679554-xfhxx                     1/1     Running            0             18m
llm-engine-cacher-5f8b794585-fq7dj             1/1     Running            0             18m
llm-engine-endpoint-builder-5cd6bf5bbc-sm254   1/1     Running            0             18m
llm-engine-image-cache-a10-sw4pg               1/1     Running            0             18m 
```
Note the pod names you see may be different.

Forward a port from a `llm-engine` pod:
```
$ kubectl port-forward pod/llm-engine-<REST_OF_POD_NAME> 5000:5000 -n <NAMESPACE_WHERE_LLM_ENGINE_IS_INSTALLED>
```

Then, try sending a request to get LLM model endpoints for `test-user-id`:
```
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u "test-user-id:" "http://localhost:5000/v1/llm/model-endpoints"
```

You should get the following response:
```
{"model_endpoints":[]}
```

Next, let's create a LLM endpoint using llama-7b:
```
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/v1/llm/model-endpoints' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "llama-7b",
        "model_name": "llama-7b",
        "source": "hugging_face",
        "inference_framework": "text_generation_inference",
        "inference_framework_image_tag": "0.9.3",
        "num_shards": 4,
        "endpoint_type": "streaming",
        "cpus": 32,
        "gpus": 4,
        "memory": "40Gi",
        "storage": "40Gi",
        "gpu_type": "nvidia-ampere-a10",
        "min_workers": 1,
        "max_workers": 12,
        "per_worker": 1,
        "labels": {},
        "metadata": {}
    }' \
    -u test_user_id:
```

It should output something like:
```
{"endpoint_creation_task_id":"8d323344-b1b5-497d-a851-6d6284d2f8e4"}
```

Wait a few minutes for the endpoint to be ready. You can tell that it's ready by listing pods and checking that all containers in the llm endpoint pod are ready:
```
$ kubectl get pods -n <endpoint_namespace specified in values_sample.yaml>
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
llm-engine-endpoint-id-end-cismpd08agn003rr2kc0-7f86ff64f9qj9xp   2/2     Running   1 (4m41s ago)   7m26s
```
Note the endpoint name could be different.

Then, you can send an inference request to the endppoint:
```
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/v1/llm/completions-sync?model_endpoint_name=llama-7b' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "prompts": ["Tell me a joke about AI"],
        "max_new_tokens": 30,
        "temperature": 0.1
    }' \
    -u test-user-id:
```

You should get a response similar to:
```
{"status":"SUCCESS","outputs":[{"text":". Tell me a joke about AI. Tell me a joke about AI. Tell me a joke about AI. Tell me","num_completion_tokens":30}],"traceback":null}
```
