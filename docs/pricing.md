# Pricing

LLM Engine is being offered initially as a free preview. LLM Engine is an open-source project and free self-hosting will always be an option.

## Hosted Models

Once the limited preview period has ended, billing for hosted models will be managed through Scale's [Spellbook](https://spellbook.scale.com/settings) product.

Scale Spellbook leverages usage-based spending, billed to a credit card.

Scale will share usage-based pricing before completing the limited preview to all users.

## Self-Hosted Models

We are committed to supporting the open-source community. Self-hosting LLM Engine will remain free and open-source.
