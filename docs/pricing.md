# Pricing

LLM Engine is an open-source project and free [self-hosting](../guides/self_hosting) will always be an option.

A hosted option for LLM Engine is being offered initially as a free preview via [Scale](https://scale.com/) [Spellbook](https://spellbook.scale.com/).

## Self-Hosted Models

We are committed to supporting the open-source community. [Self-hosting](../guides/self_hosting) LLM Engine will remain free and open-source.

We would love [contributions](../contributing) from the community make this even more amazing!
## Hosted Models

Once the limited preview period has ended, billing for hosted models will be managed through the Scale [Spellbook](https://spellbook.scale.com/settings) product.

Scale Spellbook leverages usage-based spending, billed to a credit card. Details on usage-based pricing will be shared with everyone before completing the limited preview.
